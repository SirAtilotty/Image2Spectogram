# Image2Spectogram
This tool converts a given image into a spectrogram representation.

The project is currently in beta and still under active development.

To generate a valid spectrogram, the input image must meet the following requirements:

The image must be black and white (white subject on a black background).

The image resolution must be 64x16 pixels.

(Yes, this is intentionally low for now and will be improved in future versions.)

An external application is required to view the generated spectrogram (for example, Audacity).

WARNİNG: DONT FORGET TO PUT THE IMAGE AND THE FİLE İN THE SAME FOLDER

WARNİNG2:THE İMAGE NAME MUST BE MESSAGE.PNG (if u want to change you shold change in the code too)
